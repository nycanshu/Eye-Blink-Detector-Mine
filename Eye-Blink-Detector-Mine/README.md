# Eye-Blink-Detector

![](assets/working.png)

As you can see, we're going to build a project of computer vision using opencv that will count the number of blinks.

We are only observing one eye here but you can create it for both eyes and try to work it out yourself.

# Libraries 
- opencv-python
- mediapipe

## Applications - 
You can maybe use it for security purposes like a fixed number of blinks opens up something. It may be useful in health sector(<u>try to find yourself</u>)
